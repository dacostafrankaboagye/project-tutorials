# Learning Projects
Project-based learning is a fantastic way to grow as an engineer, and I have taken inspiration from various online resources like YouTubers, blogs, and community-driven platforms. These projects represent the skills and techniques I‚Äôve picked up along the way.

Each project is designed to solve real-world problems or demonstrate core concepts for my personal learning and growth.
